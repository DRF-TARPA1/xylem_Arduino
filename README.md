# Author

# Overview
This repository described a detailed protocol for constructing and operating a pressure-drop hydraulics flow meter that can be used for stem hydraulics with the support of Arduino microcontroller. xylemArduino have been planified as a backup solution to the expensive commercial solution XYLE'M plus which was defected, and now it become our mainstream solution with addition of Arduino to this open project:
